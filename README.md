# Overview

The GitHub repo is dedicated to the development of a new monetary system on blockchain technology, specifically the creation of a new cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin. The name KaseiCoin is derived from the Japanese word "Kasei," which means "Mars," and the coin will serve as a medium of exchange for the first settlers on Mars.

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant, which means it will operate on the Ethereum blockchain and will be compatible with Ethereum wallets and exchanges. The ERC-20 standard ensures that KaseiCoin will have uniformity and consistency, making it easy to use and trade.

To facilitate the launch of KaseiCoin, the team behind the project will hold a crowdsale, allowing individuals who are planning to move to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin. This crowdsale will enable the team to raise the funds necessary to develop and launch the cryptocurrency.

The benefits of using blockchain technology and a cryptocurrency like KaseiCoin include transparency, security, and decentralization. Blockchain technology ensures that all transactions are recorded on an immutable ledger, providing transparency and preventing fraud. Additionally, the decentralized nature of blockchain technology means that there is no central authority controlling the currency, which increases security and makes it resistant to manipulation.

Overall, the development of KaseiCoin and the monetary system on which it will operate represent an exciting and innovative approach to creating a currency for the first settlers on Mars, using the power of blockchain technology.
